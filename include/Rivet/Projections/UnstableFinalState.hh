  /// @brief Project out all physical-but-decayed particles in an event.
  ///
  /// The particles returned by the UFS are unique unstable particles, such as
  /// hadrons which are decayed by the generator. If, for example, you set Ks
  /// and Lambda particles stable in the generator, they will not be returned by
  /// the UFS. Also, you should be aware that all unstable particles in a decay
  /// chain are returned: if you are looking for something like the number of B
  /// hadrons in an event and there is a decay chain from e.g. B** -> B, you
  /// will count both B mesons unless you are careful to check for
  /// ancestor/descendent relations between the particles. Duplicate particles
  /// in the event record, i.e. those which differ only in bookkeeping details
  /// or photon emissions, are stripped from the returned particles collection.
  ///
  /// @todo Inherit directly from ParticleFinder, rename as UnstableFinder, and make TauFinder inherit/use
