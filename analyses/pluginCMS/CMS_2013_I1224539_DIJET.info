  $(\pT_1 + \pT_2) / 2.0 > 220$ GeV with both jets satisfying $|y| < 2.4$.

Description:
  'Measurements of the mass spectra of the jets in dijet and $W/Z$+jet events from proton--proton
  collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using a data sample of integrated luminosity of
  5 fb$^-1$. The jets are reconstructed using the both the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with $R=0.7$ (AK7) and the
  Cambridge-Aachen algorithm with $R=0.8$ (CA8) and $R=1.2$ (CA12) with several grooming
  techniques applied (ungroomed, filtered, pruned and trimmed). See the text of the paper for
  more details. For the dijet events the distributions are presented as a function of the mean
  mass of the two leading jets in bins of the mean \pT of the two jets.'
