Description:
  Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for Higgs
  boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8TeV. The 
  analysis is performed in the Higgs diphoton decay channel using 20.3/fb of data 
  recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  The signal 
  yields are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution. 
  Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables 
  related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs 
  boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but
  broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.
