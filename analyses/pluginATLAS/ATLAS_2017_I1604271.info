Description:
 'Inclusive jet production cross-sections are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=8 TeV 
  recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The total integrated luminosity of the analysed data set 
  amounts to 20.2 fb-1. Double-differential cross-sections are measured for jets defined by the anti-kt jet clustering algorithm 
  with radius parameters of R=0.4 and R=0.6 and are presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum, in the range between 
  70 GeV and 2.5 TeV and in six bins of the absolute jet rapidity, between 0 and 3.0. The measured cross-sections are compared to 
  predictions of quantum chromodynamics, calculated at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, and corrected for 
  non-perturbative and electroweak effects. The level of agreement with predictions, using a selection of different parton 
  distribution functions for the proton, is quantified. Tensions between the data and the theory predictions are observed.'
