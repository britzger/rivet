We have presented a users' guide for the Rivet event-generator validation
system. This manual is intended to be a
guide to using Rivet, rather than a comprehensive
reference to the application programming interface (API) of the Rivet
library. Rivet is a C++ class library, which provides the infrastructure and
calculational tools for simulation-level analyses for high energy collider
experiments, enabling physicists to
validate event generator models and tunings with minimal effort and maximum
portability. It is designed to scale effectively to large numbers of analyses
for truly global validation, by transparent use of an automated result caching
system.

In addition to an introduction to the philosophy behind the framework, we
have given examples on how to implement the user's own analysis module.
A selected list of available analyses has been given as an example of the
flexibility of the full framework.
