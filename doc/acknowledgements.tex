Rivet development has been supported by a variety of sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item All authors acknowledge support from the EU MCnet research network. MCnet
  is a Marie Curie Training Network funded under Framework Programme 6
  contract MRTN-CT-2006-035606 and Framework Programme 7 contract PITN-GA-2012-315877.
\item Andy Buckley has been supported by grants from the UK Science and
  Technology Facilities Council (Special Project Grant), the Scottish
  Universities Physics Alliance (Advanced Research Fellowship),

  for Particle Physics Phenomenology (Associateship), and a CERN Scientific
  Associateship.

We also wish to thank the CERN MCplots (\url{http://mcplots.cern.ch}) team, and
especially Anton Karneyeu, for doing the pre-release testing since the Rivet 1.5
series and pointing out all the bits that we got wrong: Rivet is a much better
system as a result!
