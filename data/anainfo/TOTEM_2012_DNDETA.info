Description:
  'The TOTEM experiment has measured the charged particle pseudorapidity
  density $dN_\text{ch}/d\eta$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$\,TeV
  for $5.3 < |\eta| < 6.4$ in events with at least one charged particle
  with transverse momentum above 40 MeV/c in this pseudorapidity range.'
