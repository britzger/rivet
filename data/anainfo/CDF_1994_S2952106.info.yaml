RunInfo:
  * Energy: sqrt(s) = 1800 GeV
  * Event type: generic QCD events
  * Cut on primary vertex $z$ position: z(PV) < 60 cm
  * pTmin: leading jet = 100 GeV; and 3rd jet = 10 GeV
  * Max. pseudorapidity range of 2nd and 3rd jets: $|eta| < 0.7$
  * Azimuthal angle requirement: $\Delta{\phi} < \pi/18$ (transverse back-to-backness)
  * MET cut requirement: $mET/\sqrt{\text{Scalar }E_T} < 6.0 GeV$
Description:
  CDF Run I color coherence analysis. Events with $\ge 3$ jets are
  selected and Et distributions of the three highest-pT jets are
  obtained. The plotted quantities are the $\Delta{R}$ between the 2nd
  and 3rd leading jets in the pT and pseudorapidity of the 3rd jet, and
  $\alpha = \mathrm{d}{\eta}/\mathrm{d}{\phi}$, where $\mathrm{d}{\eta}$
  is the pseudorapidity difference between the 2nd and 3rd jets and
  $\mathrm{d}{\phi}$ is their azimuthal angle difference.  Since the
  data has not been detector-corrected, a bin by bin correction is
  applied, based on the distributions with ideal and CDF simulation as
  given in the publication.
