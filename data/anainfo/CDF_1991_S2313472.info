Description:
  This is a CDF analysis from run 1, where the distribution of the transverse
  momentum of W candidates that decay  electronically, is measured. The 
  electron is required to be within $\left|\eta\right| < 1.1$, to have
  a transverse energy of $E_\perp > 20~\GeV$ and a $p_\perp > 12~\GeV$.
  The neutrino is required to produce a missing energy of 
  $E_{\perp, \text{ miss}}>20~\GeV$.
