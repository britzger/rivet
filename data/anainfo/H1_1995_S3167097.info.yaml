Description:
  DIS events at low x may be sensitive to new QCD dynamics such as BFKL
  or CCFM radiation. In particular, BFKL is expected to produce more
  radiation at high transverse energy  in the rapidity span between the
  proton remnant and the struck quark jet. Performing a transverse
  energy sum in bins of x and $\eta$ may distinguish between DGLAP and
  BFKL evolution.
