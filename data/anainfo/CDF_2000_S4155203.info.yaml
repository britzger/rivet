RunInfo:
  * Tevatron Run I: p pbar collisions at 1800 GeV
  * Z Drell-Yan with e+ e- decay mode (for Z \emph{and} $\gamma*$) only.
Description:
  Measurement of transverse momentum and total cross section of e^+e^-
  pairs in the Z-boson region of $66~\text{GeV}/c^2 < m_{ee} <
  116~\text{GeV}/c^2$ from pbar-p collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.8 TeV, with
  the Tevatron CDF detector.  The Z pT, in a fully-factorised picture,
  is generated by the momentum balance against initial state radiation
  (ISR) and the primordial/intrinsic pT of the Z's parent partons in the
  incoming hadrons. The Z pT is important in generator tuning to fix the
  interplay of ISR and multi-parton interactions (MPI) ingenerating
  `underlying event' activity.  This analysis is subject to ambiguities
  in the experimental Z pT definition,since the Rivet implementation
  reconstructs the Z momentum from the dileptonpair with finite cones
  for photon brem summation, rather than YFS unfoldingor a non-portable
  direct access to the Z in the event record.
