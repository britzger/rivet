RunInfo:
  Requires the process $p\bar{p} \rightarrow {W} \rightarrow{e}\nu$, 
  additional hard jets will also have to be included to get a good 
  description. The LO process in Herwig is set with IPROC=1451.

Description:
  Measurement of the cross section for W boson production in association
  with jets in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. The
  analysis uses 320 pb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the CDF II
  detector. W bosons are identified in their $e\nu$ decay channel and
  jets are reconstructed using an $R < 0.4$ cone algorithm. For each $W
  + \geq$ n-jet sample (where n = 1--4) a measurement of
  d$\sigma({p}\bar{p} \rightarrow W + \geq$ n jet)/d$E_T(n^{th}$-jet)
  $\times$ BR($W \rightarrow{e}\nu$) is made, where d$E_T(n^{th}$-jet)
  is the Et of the n$^{th}$-highest Et jet above 20 GeV. A measurement
  of the total cross section, $\sigma(p\bar{p} \rightarrow W + \geq$
  n-jet) $\times$ BR($W \rightarrow{e}\nu)$ with $E_T(n^{th}-jet) > 25$
  GeV is also made. Both measurements are made for jets with $|\eta| <
  2$ and for a limited region of the $W \rightarrow{e}\nu$ decay phase
  space; $|\eta^{e}| < 1.1$, $p_{T}^{e} > 20$ GeV, $p_{T}^{\nu} > 30$
  GeV and $M_{T} > 20$ GeV. The cross sections are corrected for all
  detector effects and can be directly compared to particle level $W$ +
  jet(s) predictions. These measurements can be used to test and tune
  QCD predictions for the number of jets in and kinematics of $W$ + jets
  events.
