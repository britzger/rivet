Description:
  A study of $p\bar{p}$ collisions at sqrt(s) = 1800 and 630 GeV collected
  using a minimum bias trigger in which the data set is divided into two
  classes corresponding to `soft' and `hard' interactions. For each
  subsample, the analysis includes measurements of the multiplicity,
  transverse momentum (pT) spectra, and the average pT and event-by-event
  pT dispersion as a function of multiplicity. A comparison of
  results shows distinct differences in the behavior of the two samples
  as a function of the center of mass energy. The properties of the soft
  sample are invariant as a function of c.m. energy.
