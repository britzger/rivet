Description:
  Analysis of charm quark fragmentation at 10.6 GeV, based on a data
  sample of 103 fb collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB accelerator. 
  Fragmentation into charm is studied for the main charmed hadron ground states, 
  namely $D^0$, $D^+$, $D^+_s$ and $\Lambda_c^+$, as well as the excited states 
  $D^{*0}$ and $D^{*+}$. This analysis can be used to constrain charm fragmentation 
  in Monte Carlo generators. As the original data are not corrected for the branching ratios
  of the decay modes used to observed the charm hadrons we also include distributions with
  unit normalisation which are more useful for Monte Carlo tuning.
