Description:
   'Measurement of dijet angular distributions in proton-proton collisions at a
   center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data sample has a total integrated
   luminosity of 2.2 inverse femtobarns, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC.
   Normalized dijet angular distributions have been measured for dijet invariant
   masses from 0.4 TeV to above 3 TeV.'
