Description:
   'Measurement of the elastic differential cross-section in proton-proton interactions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7\;\TeV$ at the LHC.
    The data, which cover the $|t|$ range $0.005-0.2\;\GeV^2$, were collected using Roman Pot detectors very close to the outgoing beam
    in October 2011, allowing the precise extrapolation down to the optical point, $t = 0$, and hence the derivation of the elastic as well as
    the total cross-section via the optical theorem.'
