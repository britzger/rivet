RunInfo:
  Tevatron Run 2 conditions:
  
  
  * ppbar -> mu+ mu- + jets at 1960 GeV
  * Needs mass cut on lepton pair to avoid photon singularity: min. range $65 < m_Z < 115$
Description:
  Cross sections as a function of pT and rapidity of the boson and pT
  and rapidity of the leading jet in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96
  TeV, based on an integrated luminosity of $1.0~\text{fb}^-1$.
