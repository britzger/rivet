RunInfo:
  * Requires gamma + jet (q,qbar,g) hard processes
  
    * for Pythia 6, MSEL=10 for with MSUB indices 14, 18, 29, 114, 115 enabled
  * Lowest pT bin is at 23 GeV: a pT_min cut at ~10--15 GeV may be   required to get good statistics.
Description:
  Measurement of differential cross section for inclusive production of
  isolated photons in p pbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV with the
  D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The photons span
  transverse momenta 23--300 GeV and have pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 0.9$.
  Isolated direct photons are probes of pQCD via the annihilation (q
  qbar -> gamma g) and quark-gluon Compton scattering (q g -> gamma q)
  processes, the latter of which is also sensitive to the gluon PDF. The
  initial state radiation / resummation formalisms are sensitive to the
  resulting photon pT spectrum
