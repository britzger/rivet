Name: MC_LHC_ZANALYSIS
SpiresID: none
Summary: finding Zs at the LHC, and analysis of the residual jets.
Description: analysis of jets and Z bosons at the LHC. Output gives
             charged multiplicity, transverse momentum, mean 
             transverse momentum, Z counts, transverse momentum of
             Zs, pseudorapidity distributions of Zs, azimuthal angle
             distributions of Zs, Z mass, jet counts and jet transverse
             momenta.
RunInfo: Energy - Any. Event type - generic QCD events, with CKIN(3)=20.
