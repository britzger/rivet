Description:
  The inclusive dijet production double differential cross section as a
  function of the dijet invariant mass and of the largest absolute rapidity
  ($|y|_\text{max}$) of the two jets with the largest transverse momentum in an
  event is measured using 0.7 fb$^{-1}$ of data.
  The measurement is performed in six rapidity regions up to
  $|y|_\text{max}=2.4$.
