  Tevatron Run 2: ppbar QCD interactions at 1960 GeV.
Description:
  Correlations in the azimuthal angle between the two largest pT jets
  have been measured using the D0 detector in ppbar collisions at 1960
  GeV. The analysis is based on an inclusive dijet event sample in the
  central rapidity region. The correlations are determined for four
  different pT intervals.
