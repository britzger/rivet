RunInfo:
  Tevatron Run 2 conditions:
  * ppbar -> e+ e- + jets at 1960 GeV
  * Needs mass cut on lepton pair to avoid photon singularity: min. range $75 < m_ee < 105$
Description:
  Cross sections as a function of pT of the three leading jets and n-jet
  cross section ratios in ppbar collisions at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV, based
  on an integrated luminosity of 0.4 fb^-1.
