Description:
  'Pseudorapidity gap distributions in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 
  TeV are studied using a minimum bias data sample with an integrated luminosity of 7.1 
  inverse microbarns. Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of Delta eta F, 
  the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity, 
  at eta = +/- 4.9, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum 
  threshold p_T Cut. The measurements span the region 0 < Delta eta F < 8 for 
  200 < p_T Cut < 800 MeV. At small Delta eta F, the data test the reliability of hadronisation 
  models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle 
  production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single 
  diffractive dissociation process (pp -> Xp), enhanced by double dissociation (pp -> XY) where 
  the invariant mass of the lighter of the two dissociation systems satisfies M_Y <~ 7 GeV. 
  The resulting cross section is d sigma / d Delta eta F ~ 1 mb for Delta eta F >~ 3. The large 
  rapidity gap data are used to constrain the value of the pomeron intercept appropriate to triple 
  Regge models of soft diffraction. The cross section integrated over all gap sizes is compared with 
  other LHC inelastic cross section measurements. '
