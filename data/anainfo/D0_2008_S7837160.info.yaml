RunInfo:
  * Event type: W production with decay to e nu_e only
  
    * for Pythia 6: MSEL = 12, MDME(206,1) = 1
  
  * Energy: 1.96 TeV
Description:
  Measurement of the electron charge asymmetry in p pbar -> W + X -> e
  nu_e  + X events at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The asymmetry
  is measured as a function of the electron transverse momentum and
  pseudorapidity in the interval (-3.2, 3.2).  This data is sensitive to
  proton parton distribution functions due to the valence asymmetry in
  the incoming quarks which produce the W. Initial state radiation
  should also affect the pT distribution.
