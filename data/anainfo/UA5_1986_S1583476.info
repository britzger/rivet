RunInfo:
  Elastic scattering, single and double diffractive events. ppbar collider, c.m energy 200 or 900 GeV.
  The trigger implementations for NSD events is the same as in, e.g., the UA5_1989 analysis. No
  further cuts are needed.

Description:
  This study comprises measurements of pseudorapidity distributions measured with the UA5
  detector at 200 and 900 GeV center of momentum energy. There are distributions for
  non-single diffractive (NSD) events and als for the combination of single- and double-diffractive
  events. The NSD distributions are further studied for certain ranges of the events charged
  multiplicity.
