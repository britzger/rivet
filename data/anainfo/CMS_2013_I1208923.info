Description:
  'The single jet differential cross section has been measured as a function of
  the jet momentum and the dijet differential cross section as a function of the
  dijet mass. The data has been recorded by the CMS detector at the center of
  mass energy of 7 TeV. To reconstruct the jets, the anti-$k_T$ algorithm with a
  cone radius of $R = 0.7$ (AK7) has been used. The results are split into five
  rapditiy bins, ranging from 0.0 to 2.5 with a width of 0.5 each.'
