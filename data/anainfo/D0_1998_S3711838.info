Description:
  This is a D0 analysis from run 1, where the distribution of the transverse
  momentum of W candidates that decay  electronically, is measured. The electron
  is required to be within $\left|\eta\right| < 1.1$ and to have a transverse
  energy of $E_\perp > 25~\GeV$.  The neutrino is required to produce a missing
  energy of $E_{\perp, \text{ miss}}>25~\GeV$. The analysed data sample is three
  times as large as the similar measurement performed at CDF in 1991.
