RunInfo:
  Requires  $2\rightarrow{2}$ QCD scattering processes. The minimum jet Et is 52 GeV, so a cut on kinematic pTmin may be required for good statistics.

Description:
  A measurement of the shapes of b-jets using 300 pb$^{-1}$ of data
  obtained with CDF II in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV.
  The measured quantity is the average integrated jet shape, which is
  computed over an ensemble of jets. This quantity is expressed as
  $\Psi(r/R) = \langle\frac{p_T(0 \rightarrow r)}{p_T(0 \rightarrow
  R)}\rangle$, where pT (0$\rightarrow$r) is the scalar sum of the
  transverse momenta of all objects inside a sub-cone of radius r around
  the jet axis. The integrated shapes are by definition normalized such
  that  $\Psi(r/R =1) = 1$.   The measurement is done in bins of jet pT
  in the range 52 to 300 GeV/c. The jets have $|\eta| < 0.7$. The b-jets
  are expected to be broader than inclusive jets.Moreover, b-jets
  containing a single b-quark are expected to be narrower than those
  containing a b bbar pair from gluon splitting.
