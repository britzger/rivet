Description:
  Multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in non-single-diffractive 
  collisions between protons and antiprotons at centre-of-mass energies of 200 and 
  900 GeV. The data were recorded in the UA5 streamer chambers at the CERN collider, 
  which was operated in a pulsed mode between the two energies. This analysis
  confirms the violation of KNO scaling in full phase space found by the UA5 group 
  at an energy of 546 GeV, with similar measurements at 200 and 900 GeV.
