Description:
  'A measurement of the additional jet activity in dileptonic ttbar events. The
  fraction of events passing a veto requirement are shown as a function the veto
  scale for four central rapidity intervals.
  Two veto definitions are used: events are vetoed if they contain an additional
  jet in the rapidity interval with transverse momentum above a threshold, or 
  alternatively, if the scalar transverse momentum sum of all additional jets 
  in the rapidity interval is above a threshold.'
