RunInfo:
  * Two different beam energies: sqrt(s) = 630 & 1800 GeV
  * Event type: generic QCD events
  * Several pTmin cutoffs are probably required to fill the profile  histograms, e.g.
  
    * { 0 (min bias), 30, 90, 150 GeV } at 1800 GeV; and
    * { 0 (min bias), 20, 90, 150 GeV } at 630 GeV
Description:
  This analysis studies the underlying event via transverse cones of  $R
  = 0.7$ at 90 degrees in \phi relative to the leading (highest E) jet,
  at sqrt(s) = 630 and 1800 GeV. This is similar to the 2001 CDF UE
  analysis, except that cones, rather than the whole central \eta range
  are used. The transverse cones are categorised as TransMIN and
  TransMAX on an event-by-event basis, to give greater sensitivity to
  the UE component.  'Swiss Cheese' distributions, where cones around
  the leading $n$ jets are excluded from the distributions, are also
  included for $n = 2, 3$.  This analysis is useful for constraining the
  energy evolution of the underlying event, since it performs the same
  analyses at two distinct CoM energies.  WARNING: this analysis is not
  currently considered valid for MC tuning and validation studies due to
  ambiguities in the paper and non-reproducability of the MC plots shown
  in the paper. The fit to data is sufficiently poor that this analysis
  skews the overall goodness of fit in tuning studies, and has to be
  excluded. If you can help to improve this analysis and make it usable
  for validation studies, please get in touch!
