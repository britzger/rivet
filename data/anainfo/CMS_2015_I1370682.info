Description:
	'The reconstruction of particle-level top quarks and anti-quarks is implemented in this module. Measurements at $sqrt{s} = 8 TeV are based on parton-level information in the full phase space using MADGRAPH+PYTHIA6. To match the particle-level top quark distributions to the measurements unfolded to the parton-level, a correction function to the particle-level distributions, derived using the same MADGRAPH+PYTHIA6 configuration that was used for the original measurement of the data points, ias applied.  Using the same MC configuration as used for the unfolding to correct back the parton-level to particle-level,  the model dependence introduced in unfolding to parton-level and extrapolating the measurement to the full phase space is eliminated.

In this analysis, the particle-level top quark is defined using the following particle definitions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Dressed lepton} : An object constructed by applying the anti-$k_{T}$ jet clustering~\cite{antikt} with a distance parameter of $R=0.1$ to the collection of final state electrons, muons and photons that do not originate from hadron decays. 
The clustered objects that pass the acceptance cuts (\pt $> 20$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$) are considered.
\item{Prompt neutrino} : A neutrino that does not originate from a hadronic decay. 
\item{Ghost B hadron} : A weakly decaying hadron with B flavor and its decay products are selected. 
Since both the B hadron and its decay products are included, the momenta of the B hadron is rescaled by a very small factor ($10^{-20}$) to be used in the jet clustering. This avoids double-counting, but retains information about the origin of the decay products. 
\item{Jet} : A jet is constructed applying the anti-$k_{T}$ jet clustering algorithm with a distance parameter of $R=0.5$ to the collection of all particles except neutrinos and constituents of dressed leptons. For the generator level b-jet finding, ghost B hadrons are also added to the jet clustering. Jets are required to pass acceptance cuts of \pt$ > 30$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$.
\item{b-jets} : b-quark jets are defined as the jets with a Ghost B hadron among their constituents.
\end{itemize}

Based on the particle-level objects defined above, W bosons and top quarks are reconstructed using W boson and top quark mass constraints, respectively, as described below:  
\begin{itemize}
\item{particle-level W boson pair} : Combinations of dressed lepton and prompt neutrinos are made to reconstruct the particle-level $W$ boson candidate that decays to a lepton-neutrino pair. The same is done with jets without B hadrons to reconstruct the $W$ boson decaying hadronically. 
The event is considered as lepton + jet channel if only one lepton + neutrino pair exists. If there are two lepton + neutrino pairs in the event, the event is considered in the dilepton channel. The pair that gives the minimum of $|M_W^a-80.4~{\rm GeV}| + |M_W^b-80.4~{\rm GeV}|$ is defined as the particle-level W boson pair.
\item{particle-level top quark pair} : Combinations of particle-level W bosons and b jets are considered to reconstruct the top and the anti-top quarks in the event. The pair that yields the minimum of $|M_{top}^a-172.5$ GeV$|$ + $|M_{top}^b-172.5$ GeV$|$ is defined as the particle-level top quark pair.
\end{itemize}

Finally, decay channel dependent selections are made to mimic those applied on the reconstructed data. The existence of only one lepton with \pt $ > 33$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.1$ for the lepton+jet channel, and two opposite charge leptons with \pt$ > 20$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$ for the dilepton channel are required. 

Using the particle-level definition above, bin-by-bin correction factors are derived
\begin{equation}
C_i = \frac{\sigma_i^\text{parton}({\rm full~phase~space})}{\sigma_i^\text{particle}({\rm fiducial~volume})},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$ is the cross-section in bin $i$, ``parton'' refers to top quarks or anti-quarks before the decay, ``particle'' refers to top quarks or anti-quarks as defined in the RIVET implementation above.'
