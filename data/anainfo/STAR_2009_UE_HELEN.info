Description:
  UE analysis similar to Rick Field's leading jet analysis. SIScone with
  radius/resolution paramter R=0.7 is used. Particles with pT > 0.2 GeV
  and |eta| < 1 are included in the analysis. All particles are assumed
  to have zero mass. Only jets with neutral energy < 0.7 are included.
  For the transMIN and transMAX delta(Phi) is between pi/3 and 2pi/3 and
  delta(eta)<2.0. For the jet region the area of the jet is used for the
  normalization, i.e. the scaling factor is pi*R^2 and not dphi*deta (this
  is different from what Rick Field does!). The tracking efficiency is ~0.8,
  but that is an approximation, as below pT~0.6GeV it is falling quite
  steeply.
