Description:
  Minimum bias data measured by ATLAS at 900 and 7000 GeV. Same as
  ATLAS_2010_S8591806, but with an additional cut on the charged particle
  multiplicity of $N_\mathrm{ch} \ge 6$. $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $p_\perp > 500$ MeV.
  All data is corrected to the particle level. ATTENTION - Data read from plots!
