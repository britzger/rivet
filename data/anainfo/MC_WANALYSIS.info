Name: MC_WANALYSIS
Summary: "Finding leptonic Ws at the LHC, and analysis of the residual jets."
Description: 
  Analysis of jets and W$^\pm$ bosons. Output gives charged multiplicity,
  transverse momentum, mean transverse momentum, W counts, transverse momentum of
  Ws, pseudorapidity distributions of Ws, azimuthal angle distributions of Ws, W
  mass, jet counts and jet transverse momenta.
RunInfo: W production events with CKIN(3)=20 at any energy
