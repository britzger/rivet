  RHIC d-Au 200 GeV run conditions:
  
  
  * d-Au at 200 GeV (use pp Monte Carlo! See description.)
Description:
  Correlation in $\eta$ and $\phi$ between the charged hadron with the
  highest pT (``trigger particle'') and the other charged hadrons in the
  event (``associated particles''). The data was collected in d-Au
  collisions at 200 GeV. Nevertheless, it is very proton-proton like and
  can therefore be compared to pp Monte Carlo (not for tuning, but for
  qualitative studies).
