Description:
  First measurement of the azimuthal decorrelation between jets with
  pseudorapidity separation up to five units. The data were accumulated using
  the D0 detector during Tevatron run 1 at $\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV.
  So far, this analysis is using the wrong jet algorithm, namely the D0 Run II
  Improved Legacy cone.
