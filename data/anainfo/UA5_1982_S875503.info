Summary: "UA5 multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions for PP and PPBar."
Description: "Comparisons of multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions for PP
	     and PPBar collisions at 53 GeV, based on the UA5 53GeV runs in 1982.
             Data confirms the lack of significant difference between the two beams."
RunInfo: Generic QCD events at sqrtS = 53 GeV.
