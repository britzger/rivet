  * Particles with $c \tau > {}$10 mm should be set stable.
Description:
  Niccolo Moggi's minbias analysis. Minimum bias events are used to
  measure the average track pT vs charged multiplicity, a track pT
  distribution and an inclusive $\sum E_T$ distribution.  WARNING: Only
  average track pT vs charged multiplicity is validated!
