Description:
  Niccolo Moggi's min bias analysis. Minimum bias events are used to
  measure the average track pT vs. charged multiplicity, a track pT
  distribution and an inclusive $\sum E_T$ distribution. 
  WARNING, only average track pT vs. charged multiplicity is validated,
  the other two distributions look good but don't exactly match the
  Monte Carlo curves in the paper!
