RunInfo:
  ppbar -> e+ e- + jets at 1960 GeV. Needs mass cut on lepton pair to 
  avoid photon singularity, $m$ in range $66 < m_ee < 116$
NumEvents: 1000000
PtCuts: [0]
Description:
  Cross sections as a function of jet transverse momentum in 1 and 2 jet
  events, and jet multiplicity in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96
  TeV, based on an integrated luminosity of 1.7 fb^-1. The measurements
  cover the rapidity region $|y_\text{jet}| < 2.1$ and the transverse
  momentum range $pT_\text{jet} > 30~\text{GeV}/c$.
