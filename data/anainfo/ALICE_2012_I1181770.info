Description:
  'Measurements of cross-sections of inelastic and diffractive processes in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 900$, 2760 and 7000 GeV.
   The fractions of diffractive processes in inelastic collisions were determined from a study of gaps in charged particle pseudorapidity distributions.
   Single-diffractive events are selected with $M_{X} < 200\;\GeV/c^2$ and double-diffractive events defined as NSD events with $\Delta\eta > 3$.
   To measure the inelastic cross-section, beam properties were determined with van der Meer scans using a simulation of diffraction adjusted to data.

   Note that these are experimental approximations to theoretical concepts -- it is not totally clear whether the data point values are model-independent.'
