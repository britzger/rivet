Description:
  Event shape and charged particle inclusive distributions measured
  using 750000 decays of Z bosons to hadrons from the DELPHI detector at
  LEP. This data, combined with identified particle distributions from
  all LEP experiments, was used for tuning of shower-hadronisation event
  generators by the original PROFESSOR method.  This is a critical
  analysis for MC event generator tuning of final state radiation and
  both flavour and kinematic aspects of hadronisation models.
