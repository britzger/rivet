Description:
  Data on two-particle pseudorapidity and multiplicity correlations 
  of charged particles for non single-diffractive $\bar{p}p$ collisions at 
  c.m. energies of 200, 546 and 900 GeV. Pseudorapidity correlations interpreted 
  in terms of a cluster model, which has been motivated by this and other 
  experiments, require on average about two charged particles per cluster. 
  The decay width of the clusters in pseudorapidity is approximately independent 
  of multiplicity and of c.m. energy. The investigations of correlations in terms 
  of pseudorapidity gaps confirm the picture of cluster production. The strength 
  of forward-backward multiplicity correlations increases linearly with ins and 
  depends strongly on position and size of the pseudorapidity gap separating 
  the forward and backward interval. All our correlation studies can be understood 
  in terms of a cluster model in which clusters contain on average about two 
  charged particles, i.e. are of similar magnitude to earlier estimates from the ISR.
