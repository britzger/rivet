	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Added the hz95108 energy flow
	analysis from HZtool.

	* Projections/DISLepton.*: Since many HERA measurements do not
	care if we have electron or positron beam, it is now possible to
	specify lepton or anti-lepton.

	* Projections/Event.*: Added member and access function for the
	weight of an event (taken from the GenEvent object.weights()[0].

	* Analysis/RivetHandler.*: Now depends explicitly on the AIDA
	interface. An AIDA analysis factory must be specified in the
	constructor, where a tree and histogram factory is automatically
	created. Added access functions to the relevant AIDA objects.

	* Analysis/AnalysisBase.*: Added access to the RivetHandler and
	its AIDA factories.

	* configure.ac: Added -I$THEPEGPATH/include to AM_CPPFLAGS.

	* Config/Rivet.h: Added some std incudes and using std::
	declaration.

	* Analysis/RivetInfo.*: Fixed some bugs. The RivetInfo facility
	now works, although it has not been thoroughly tested.

	* Analysis/Examples/TestMultiplicity.*: Re-introduced
	FinalStateHCM for testing purposes but commented it away again.

	* .: Made a number of changes to implement handling of RivetInfo
	objects.
