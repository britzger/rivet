	* src/Analysis/HepEx9506012.cc: Now uses the histogram booking
	function in the Analysis class.

2007-05-23  Jon Butterworth  <jmb@hep.ucl.ac.uk>

	* Fixed bug in PRD65092002 (was failing on zero jets)

2007-05-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added (but haven't properly tested) a VetoedFinalState projection.

	* Added normalize() method for AIDA 1D histograms.

	* Added configure checking for Mac OS X version, and setting the
	development target flag accordingly.

2007-05-22  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added an ostream method for AnalysisName enums.

	* Converted Analyses and Projections to use projection lists, cuts
	and beam constraints.

	* Added beam pair combining to the BeamPair sets of Projections
	by finding set meta-intersections.

	* Added methods to Cuts, Analysis and Projection to make Cut
	definition easier.

	* Fixed default fall-through in cut handling switch statement and
	now using -numeric_limits<double>::max() rather than min()

	* Added more control of logging presentation via static flag 
	methods on Log.

	
2007-05-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added self-consistency checking mechanisms for Cuts and Beam
	
	* Re-implemented the cut-handling part of RivetInfo as a Cuts class.
	
	* Changed names of Analysis and Projection name() and handler()
	methods to getName() and getHandler() to be more consistent with
	the rest of the public method names in those classes.


2007-05-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added auto-booking of histogram bins from AIDA XML files. The
	AIDA files are located via a C++ function which is generated from
	RivetPaths.cc.in by running configure.


2007-04-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added a preliminary version of the Rick Field UE analysis, under
	the name PRD65092002.

	
2007-04-19  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Analysis/HepEx0409040.cc: The reason this did not compile
	under gcc-4 is that some iterators into a vector were wrongly
	assued to be pointers and were initialized to 0 and later compared
	to 0. I've changed this to initialize to end() of the
	corresponding vector and to compare with the same end() later.

	
2007-04-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Lots of name changes in anticipation of the MCNet
	school. RivetHandler is now AnalysisHandler (since that's what it
	does!), BeamParticle has become ParticleName, and RivetInfo has
	been split into Cut and BeamConstraint portions.

	* Added BeamConstraint mechanism, which can be used to determine
	if an analysis is compatible with the beams being used in the
	generator. The ParticleName includes an "ANY" wildcard for this
	purpose.

	
2006-03-19  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added "rivet" executable which can read in HepMC ASCII dump
	files and apply Rivet analyses on the events.

	
2007-02-24  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Projections/KtJets.cc: Added comparison of member variables
	in compare() function

	* all: Merged changes from polymorphic-projections branch into
	trunk

2007-02-17  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* all: projections and analysis handlers: All projections which
	uses other projctions now has a pointer rather than a copy of
	those projections to allow for polymorphism. The constructors has
	also been changed to require the used projections themselves,
	rather than the arguments needed to construct them.

	
2007-02-17  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Projections/FinalState.cc,
	include/Rivet/Projections/FinalState.icc (Rivet),
	include/Rivet/Projections/FinalState.hh: Added cut in transverse
	momentum on the particles to be included in the final state.
	

2007-02-06  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* include/LWH/HistogramFactory.h: Fixed divide-by-zero in divide
	function. Also fixed bug in error calculation in divide
	function. Introduced checkBin function to make sure two histograms
	are equal even if they have variable bin widths.

	* include/LWH/Histogram1D.h: In normalize(double), do not do anything
	if the sum of the bins are zero to avoid dividing by zero.
	
	
2007-01-20  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Test/testLWH.cc: Modified to output files using the Tree.

	* configure.ac: Removed AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([include/Rivet/Config])
	since the directory does not exist anymore.

	
2006-12-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Rivet will now conditionally install the AIDA and LWH headers if
	it can't find them when configure'ing.

	* Started integrating Leif's LWH package to fulfill the AIDA
	duties.

	* Replaced multitude of CLHEP wrapper headers with a single
	RivetCLHEP.h header.

	
2006-11-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced log4cpp logging.

	* Added analysis enum, which can be used as input to an analysis
	factory by Rivet users.

	
2006-11-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Yet more, almost pointless, administrative moving around of
	things with the intention of making the structure a bit
	better-defined:

	* The RivetInfo and RivetHandler classes have been
	moved from src/Analysis into src as they are really the main Rivet
	interface classes. The Rivet.h header has also been moved into the
	"header root". 

	* The build of a single shared library in lib has been disabled,
	with the library being built instead in src.

	
2006-10-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced a minimal subset of the Sherpa math tools, such as
	Vector{3,4}D, Matrix, etc. The intention is to eventually cut the
	dependency on CLHEP.
	
2006-07-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Moving things around: all sources now in directories under src
	
2006-06-04  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Now uses CentralEtHCM. Also set GeV
	units on the relevant histograms.

	* Projections/CentralEtHCM.*: Making a special class just to get
	out one number - the summed Et in the central rapidity bin - may
	seem like an overkill. But in case some one else might nees it...

2006-06-03  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Added the hz95108 energy flow
	analysis from HZtool.

	* Projections/DISLepton.*: Since many HERA measurements do not
	care if we have electron or positron beam, it is now possible to
	specify lepton or anti-lepton.

	* Projections/Event.*: Added member and access function for the
	weight of an event (taken from the GenEvent object.weights()[0].

	* Analysis/RivetHandler.*: Now depends explicitly on the AIDA
	interface. An AIDA analysis factory must be specified in the
	constructor, where a tree and histogram factory is automatically
	created. Added access functions to the relevant AIDA objects.

	* Analysis/AnalysisBase.*: Added access to the RivetHandler and
	its AIDA factories.

2005-12-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* configure.ac: Added -I$THEPEGPATH/include to AM_CPPFLAGS.

	* Config/Rivet.h: Added some std incudes and using std::
	declaration.

	* Analysis/RivetInfo.*: Fixed some bugs. The RivetInfo facility
	now works, although it has not been thoroughly tested.

	* Analysis/Examples/TestMultiplicity.*: Re-introduced
	FinalStateHCM for testing purposes but commented it away again.

	* .: Made a number of changes to implement handling of RivetInfo
	objects.
