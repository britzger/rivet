	* include/LWH/HistogramFactory.h: Fixed divide-by-zero in divide
	function. Also fixed bug in error calculation in divide
	function. Introduced checkBin function to make sure two histograms
	are equal even if they have variable bin widths.

	* include/LWH/Histogram1D.h: In normalize(double), do not do anything
	if the sum of the bins are zero to avoid dividing by zero.

2007-01-20  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* src/Test/testLWH.cc: Modified to output files using the Tree.

	* configure.ac: Removed AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([include/Rivet/Config])
	since the directory does not exist anymore.

	* Rivet will now conditionally install the AIDA and LWH headers if
	it can't find them when configure'ing.

	* Started integrating Leif's LWH package to fulfill the AIDA
	duties.

	* Replaced multitude of CLHEP wrapper headers with a single
	RivetCLHEP.h header.

2006-11-20  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced log4cpp logging.

	* Added analysis enum, which can be used as input to an analysis
	factory by Rivet users.
	
2006-11-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Yet more, almost pointless, administrative moving around of
	things with the intention of making the structure a bit
	better-defined:

	* The RivetInfo and RivetHandler classes have been
	moved from src/Analysis into src as they are really the main Rivet
	interface classes. The Rivet.h header has also been moved into the
	"header root". 

	* The build of a single shared library in lib has been disabled,
	with the library being built instead in src.

2006-10-14  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Introduced a minimal subset of the Sherpa math tools, such as
	Vector{3,4}D, Matrix, etc. The intention is to eventually cut the
	dependency on CLHEP.

	* Moving things around: all sources now in directories under src

	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Now uses CentralEtHCM. Also set GeV
	units on the relevant histograms.

	* Projections/CentralEtHCM.*: Making a special class just to get
	out one number - the summed Et in the central rapidity bin - may
	seem like an overkill. But in case some one else might nees it...

2006-06-03  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* Analysis/Examples/HZ95108.*: Added the hz95108 energy flow
	analysis from HZtool.

	* Projections/DISLepton.*: Since many HERA measurements do not
	care if we have electron or positron beam, it is now possible to
	specify lepton or anti-lepton.

	* Projections/Event.*: Added member and access function for the
	weight of an event (taken from the GenEvent object.weights()[0].

	* Analysis/RivetHandler.*: Now depends explicitly on the AIDA
	interface. An AIDA analysis factory must be specified in the
	constructor, where a tree and histogram factory is automatically
	created. Added access functions to the relevant AIDA objects.

	* Analysis/AnalysisBase.*: Added access to the RivetHandler and
	its AIDA factories.

2005-12-27  Leif Lönnblad  <Leif.Lonnblad@thep.lu.se>

	* configure.ac: Added -I$THEPEGPATH/include to AM_CPPFLAGS.

	* Config/Rivet.h: Added some std incudes and using std::
	declaration.

	* Analysis/RivetInfo.*: Fixed some bugs. The RivetInfo facility
	now works, although it has not been thoroughly tested.

	* Analysis/Examples/TestMultiplicity.*: Re-introduced
	FinalStateHCM for testing purposes but commented it away again.

	* .: Made a number of changes to implement handling of RivetInfo
	objects.
